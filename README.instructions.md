# Minority Africa Backend Assessment

## High Level Instructions
- You are to build a REst API for the Minority Africa Advance Platform (Not the Rest of it Ofcourse)
- **Start off by forking this exact same Repo**
- Build 10 endpoints that you will deem important! aka That are likely to impress us.
- Checkout the pitch deck attached in this repo to read more on the Advance platform. 
- On your backend, We prefer that you use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Nodejs) and ofcourse do not use React, **No need to build any frontend**.
- We would prefer Typescript as your main programming language in the backend, However if that is steep you can resort to Javascript.
- A starter template is already setup but you can always edit it for the better
- **You do not need to build any frontend**
- Well document your API with a tool like Swagger [https://swagger.io](https://swagger.io)
- The features of Advance platform are in the below section `What the Advance Does'
- Setup a free MongoDB account to use if you don't already [https://www.mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com) so that you can setup a cloud database.
- Create a clear database schema on a tool like Lucid [https://lucid.app](https://lucid.app) or similar, **only the parts that will support your 10 endpoints.**
- Your API should be callable from Swagger or whichever API documentation tool you are using.
- Be able to account for the design decisions that you took.
- Deploy your application to either Heroku, Netlify, Microsoft Assure, or one of the AWS services
- The application must have a CI/CD pipeline. You can checkout the README.instructions.md of this repo on a CI/CD pipeline [https://github.com/Minority-Africa/front-end-dev-assessment/blob/main/README.instructions.md](https://github.com/Minority-Africa/front-end-dev-assessment), also you are provided with a CircleCi one on this repo if you want to use that

## What the Advance Does
1. The Advance platform is a self hosted web application that allows users (news
publishers) to create an account that will have to be approved by an
administrator granting them access to log on to a secure frontend dashboard.
2. This dashboard will work in two ways, allowing them access content from
Minority Africa to republish but also giving them a way to share stories with their
own subscribers.
3. They will be able to upload plain text, HD images, HD videos which subscribers
can easily republish without losing quality, connect directly into their CMS and
which automatically contains backlinks through which republishers can track
where their content is being serialised when crawled.
4. The platform needs to have a easy user friendly interface both for the users but
also for internal minority editorial team
5. The platform needs to be able to work well with the main Minority Africa website
which is build in Wordpress
